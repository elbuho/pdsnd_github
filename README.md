# Udacity-programming-for-Data-Science-With-Python-Nanodegree
This repository was created by **Jorge Muñoz Rama** and contains project 3 for Udacity  Nanodegree (Programming For Data Science Using Python)

## Project 3
This project consisted in using Git and GitHub with a simulated workflow to refactor Project 2.

### Description
In this project, you will create a GitHub repository and your local repository. You will work on a repo for your BikeShare project to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
The required files for running this program are:

- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv 
- chicago.csv

### Requirements
This program was written in Python (version 3.7.4) and used the following libraries:

- pandas version 0.25.1
- numpy version 1.16.5

### Credits
Thank you to Udacity for this Nanodegree program!

### Project Submission
The Project Submission consisted in the filling of a template with all the Git commands used to perform the requested tasks.
